## The industrial measurement that saves the world 
The main problem is the high level of pollution from industry in the cities. Pollution and air pollution affect the health especially of children and pregnant mothers, these are associated with low weight, premature death and respiratory problems such as asthma. The growth in the population in the cities makes the problem increase. In addition, there are vulnerable areas that are more exposed to industrial pollution, especially in low-income populations. Industries, factories and manufacturing companies, as well as municipalities and parents do not have pollution resolution, prevention, monitoring and control tools that allow them to take timely action based on data.

The World Health Organization estimates that globally, air pollution causes 7 million premature deaths per year, with infants and young children being among the most susceptible. In Latin America, the problem of industrial pollution is particularly acute in urban areas where many people live in close proximity to industrial facilities and where regulations may be less stringent than in more developed regions.
