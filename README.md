## leak prediction with machine learning
The study "What you don't know about steam traps" by the company SteamLoc2, most inspections of steam traps are carried out annually. An annual review of this type results in a failure cost that is equivalent to USD 3,320 of energy losses per trap in 6 months and 3.4 tons of CO2 emitted per trap. To address this, companies can increase the frequency of monitoring to reduce time to failure, but this will also increase internal or external costs to perform these checks. There are some sensors that can be integrated into each trap, these have a solution cost of around $950 per trap, which is quite expensive for the industry. On the other hand, there are solutions from 60 dollars per trap, but these only show when the trap has already failed completely open or closed and do not include the calculation of the amount of steam.
